# Fraud_Detection_System_infosysspringboard
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets. The goal is to build a reliable and efficient model that minimizes false positives and accurately identifies fraudulent activities.

🚀 Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the dataset with detailed visualizations.
Preprocessing: Handles imbalanced datasets using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE).
Feature Engineering: Selects key features to optimize model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for fraud detection.
Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve for performance evaluation.

📂 Dataset
The project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, which contains anonymized features and includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/jayantkathuria7/credit_card_fraud_detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd credit_card_fraud_detection
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

⚙️ How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform EDA to understand data distribution and detect class imbalance.
3. Train and evaluate models using different machine learning algorithms.
4. Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

📊 Results
The model achieves high accuracy and AUC-ROC scores while maintaining a balance between precision and recall to minimize fraud detection errors.
